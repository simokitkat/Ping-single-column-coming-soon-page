## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript for form validation

### What I learned

I learned about the `novalidate` attibute that can be added to the form tag so that the form doesn't get validated by the default so that it's validated JavaScript instead.
